        <h2>What are hashtags?</h2>
        <p>A hashtag is a way of saying that what you are posting online is related to a particular topic. People can click the hashtag to see other posts that use it also, to find more pictures or posts about the same thing. The more people that use the same hashtag, the easier it is to see everything else! Hashtags start with the # symbol, followed by letters and numbers. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23frc195">#frc195</a> is a hashtag people use to talk about Team 195, and <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23omgrobots">#omgrobots</a> is a hashtag people use to talk about FIRST Robotics generally.</p>
